How to use npar/mcho's trailer editor:

>>>Getting Started<<<
Before anything else can be done, a media (video or
audio) file must be opened.
This file will be played by the big media screen
in the middle of the program.

****************OPENING A MEDIA FILE*******************

There are two ways to open a media file:
  1.  You can click the 'folder' icon next to the text
      box that says "Please open a media file..."
  2.  OR you can click the "File" option in the 
      menu bar located at the top of the program
      and select the "Open" item
This will pop up a file chooser where you will need
to specify a media file to open.
You can select a media file by either clicking it, then
clicking the "Open" button, or by simply double clicking
it. 
The opened media file will be paused from the start.

NOTE: Directories have the 'folder' icon next to them, 
       and files have the 'paper' icon. You can only 
       select to open files, also any non-media files 
       will NOT open!

IF YOU HAVE NO MEDIA FILE! DON'T WORRY
If you click the DOWNLOAD button at the top left corner
You can download an open-source media file by simply
entering a URL.

**********************************************************

After a valid media file is opened, some or all of the 
playback and edit features will be enabled.

For VIDEO files: all playback and edit features are 
	enabled.
For AUDIO files: some playback features and no edit 
	features are enabled.

******GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE PLAYBACK PANEL******

The Playback panel has three buttons.
These are the buttons at the bottom center 

REWIND, PLAY, FASTFORWARD button (in that order)

To start playing the media file, click the PLAY button.
This is button right in the middle.
The video or audio will start playing.

NOTE: Audio files will play with a blank media screen.

If you click the button when the button says "Pause"
It will pause the video and will toggle to "Play".
The PLAY button will toggle from "Play" to "Pause"
depending on whether the media file is playing or not.

The other two buttons beside the PLAY button are the
rewind and fastforward buttons.
These two buttons are disabled for audio files, as it
was thought to be not a necessary feature for audios.

You've probably guessed that these buttons will 
rewind and fastforward the video.
To stop video the when it is rewinding or fastforwarding
You can either click the PLAY button to play the video
at that moment, or re-click the rewind or fastforward 
button to pause the video at the moment.

NOTE: If the video is fastforwarding and the REWIND
      button is clicked. It will begin rewinding and
      vice versa.

**********************************************************

If you haven't noticed, there is also a volume control
next to the play back panel.

This allows you, the user, to set the volume to what you
want or mute the volume. It's very easy to use, but just
in case you aren't familiar with it...

************HOW TO CONTROL THE VOLUME**************

The volume control has three buttons and a slider.
The 'mini speaker' icon is the MUTE button.
Next to it is the VOLUME slider and right below
there's a MINUS and a PLUS button.

This feature is enabled for any media (both audio and 
video)

The MUTE button has a toggle on and off, similar to the
PLAY button. When it is not muted, the icon will show a
'mini speaker' icon. If you click this, it will mute the
volume and toggle to a 'no sound' icon. 

The VOLUME slider has a thumb, which can be dragged 
back and forth to decrease and increase the volume.

The MINUS and PLUS button also decrease and 
increase the volume. 
Clicking the MINUS button will decrease the volume, 
and clicking the PLUS button will increase it.

**********************************************************

The progress bar of the video or audio is shown at the 
bottom of the media screen. At the left of the progress
bar, the video's current time is shown in hh:mm:ss 
(hours:minutes:seconds) format.

============EDIT FUNCTIONS=============

The edit function can be categorised into two 
things. 
Page addition & Audio manipulation.
These edit functions can be accessed by either: 
 1. Clicking the EDIT button (second button on top),
      which will bring up another frame with multiple
      buttons to click, for each function. 
 2. OR you can click the "Edit" option in the 
      menu bar located at the top of the program
      and select one of the function you want to use.

********************PAGE ADDITION**********************

There's two page addition functions:
 - Adding a title page ("+ Title Page" on EDIT button)
 - Adding a credit page ("+ Credit Page" on EDIT button)

Selecting one of these functions will open up a frame.

You can CHOOSE to input a text in text box. You can
also set up the font, font size and font colour for the
text that will be shown in the title/credit page.

You MUST select a background music and background 
image that will be used to make the title/credit page. 
This can be done by clicking the 'folder' icon beside 
each respective text field.

If you are unsure of how the the page will look
like with all the feature you've selected.
You can click the 'Preview' button at the top right
corner. 

After everything is set up, click the GENERATE button
and it will ask for a save name and directory. Just
go into the directory you want the output file to be
in and enter a file name in the text field. Click the
"Save" button and you're DONE with adding a page.

NOTE: The process may take a while, so enjoy a video
	or two while you wait :)

**********************************************************

Next up is the audio manipulation functions!

******************AUDIO MANIPULATION******************

There are four audio manipulation functions:
 - Remove audio from video (extract as well)
 - Extract audio from video
 - Overlay audio from video with another audio
 - Replace audio from video with another audio

------Remove
When this function is selected, it will ask if you
would like to save (extract) the audio before 
removing it.
If you select 'Yes', you will need to specify the name
and place you'd like to save the audio to.
If you select 'No' you will skip that step above.
You will need to specify a name and place you'd like
to save the audio removed video. Then after
it will do everything for you, and remove the
audio and save the video where you specified.

------Extract
This is the step from "Remove" when the user selects
that they want to save the audio. 
It will ask you to specify the name and place you'd
like to save the audio file. Then it will begin its
operation and save the extracted audio file to
the specified location.

------Overlay
Again it will ask to specify a name and place to save
the overlayed file. 
It will then open up a frame, where you will have to
select an audio file to overlay the video with. Select
by clicking the 'folder' icon.
Click overlay and the process will begin!

------Replace
Exactly the same as 'Overlay', but it completely
replaces the video's audio with the selected
audio.
